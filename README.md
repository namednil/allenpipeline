# allenpipeline

Makes it easier to build models with AllenNLP. 

(Intended) Features:
- simply define a `DatasetWriter` and you're good to go to save your model predictions
- safe model predictions on the dev data
- easy integration of external evaluation tools that receive a system prediction and a gold file
- perform your expensive decoding/parsing on your CPU for all your instances in parallel

# Usage example
Simple POS tagging.

```
bash download_example_data.sh
mkdir -p models/
python train_command.py tagger/config.jsonnet -s models/testcase -f --include-package tagger
```

# TODO
 - annotate file with trained model
 - automatically run on testset
 - policy for when to run validation with expensive decoding
 - free up GPU memory when doing decoding and no further training
